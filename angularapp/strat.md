in building angular at first with connecting with the backend
lets make first the login and its proepr page  to go, for example we have two types whihh is voter, and admin,, now after login they will be headded to the diffrente pages, so we have pages liek admin dasbopard and vote dashboard, now inside we define there endpoints via gettign user id and user role in lcoalstorage since when logj nsuuceed we wil lgive lcoastorage.. just a tips so its easier


to conenct the backend to this client angular, lets have environement file or config,, but i nthis project i use environmetn.ts then has the api url toward the url of the backend, not secure bnut will do for now since its just a practice.

in services we use that to let it call the backend via api url endpoitsn and the command we just do calls in here to conenct to the fornjtends ts file to execute
